Also, I'mma be biased here, but Kim Seon Ho as Han Ji Pyeong was great! Love the back story they set up for him, and for sure am gonna get second lead syndrome..",t3_jcpm8v
7,g98d4og,t3_jcpm8v,"Ep 2: Wow this ep really hit home for me, I can really deeply relate to the hopelessness felt by Dalmi and Dosan. The struggles of mid-to-late 20s trying to survive in their careers is very well portrayed in that beautiful train scene. Dosan trying not to let Jipyeong's harsh assessment get to him while others around him discuss about investments and buying houses/cars; Dalmi browsing through Injae's seemingly perfect life after being basically trampled all over by her company. That scene really got to me, I feel like shit many days too, and everyone else just seems so much better than I am.

Still, the grass is always greener on the other side, and other people are not necessarily living as perfect lives as they seem to be. Injae is the perfect example of someone who's pretending to be happy and ""successful at life"", when really her family is a huge mess. All fancy on the outside but really just an empty shell - if she was really happy with the life she's living now, she won't need to have this childish rivalry with Dalmi lol.

And Jipyeong... I'm disappointed by his harsh behavior this ep. I mean like yes as a VC fund manager he had every reason to reject them - but to dish out harsh words based on his own biased assumptions without even first viewing their business plan and/or assessing their prototype was uncalled for. Did Dalmi's grandma's genuine selflessness not rub off him at all? He doesn't even show 1% of that warmth she showed him. He still continues to strongly believe in his judgement, but he's not always right, as we can tell from that outro - Nam Dosan was a literal hidden pearl, and Jipyeong's judgement was very wrong this time. I know he's a tsundere character with a prickly exterior but a kind heart hidden underneath, so hopefully he loses some of this asshole-ness over time, I really still want to love ma Good Boy hahaha.

On a happier note, the Samsan trio grew on me really quickly, mostly because damn are they relatable. Coffee machines ARE a necessity for developers and definitely a good use of investment money 😜 I like the very easy to understand explanation of Image Recognition too - it's always difficult to explain to others what I do for a living lmao. 

Heartfelt at many times, humourous at others. I'm definitely getting my hopes up for this.

P.S. Omg I LOVED that Architecture 101 reference HHAHAHA

P.P.S That slow-motion of Dosan entering was so cringey omg, but I'll forgive it because NJH was literally stunning AF. (Although I'll always miss nerdy and unkempt NJH)",t3_jcpm8v

""Dal-mi. You're a Cosmos flower. And it's still spring. Wait until fall, and you'll bloom beautifully. Be patient.""

 The cosmos plant consists of flowering plants in the sunflower family and it blooms from summer through fall.

I guess we're all like cosmos flowers. We all want to bloom right away. We want to succeed and get that happiness but there's going to be a perfect time for it. It may not look good now but it's going to get better.",t3_jcpm8v

The scene where Dalmi had to take the stairs cause the escalator was ""out of order"" isn't just there to emphasize that this was a rough day for her, it actually perfectly symbolizes how she must start from the bottom and slowly climb up the stairs to success.

Wow! I didn’t expect to sit down and finish the entire episode in one sitting. I feel like that first episode was half a season in itself. It was full of stuff. I wonder what they have planned for these characters. I’m in! 

I actually liked having the characters younger with current time characters to start this series. It seems like the young character’s storylines set up what’s to come well. I feel like I already know these characters but I do hope we see a few more flashbacks that coincide with what’s going on now throughout the series.

In Jae and Suzy are also contrasts, both a bit envious of what they're missing. Success vs love/family. The mother seems broken, and the fake Instagram life hit hard. 

I loved the trio and the parents - so happy to see our dear CloY soldier in a new role. Luck has struck our trio, it seems, so let's see how it goes forward.

- OST is amazing as well!
- Cinematography is good! All of that Cherry Blossom scenes were so therapeutic
- THE VISUALS. Suzy. Seon Ho. Joo Hyuk. What more can you ask
- THE PLOT IS FANTASTIC. Every detail was fleshed out well (can’t help but compare it with the ongoing Record of Youth).

And can we talk about how good the casting for young Han Ji Pyeong was? They look sooo alike. I really loved his relationship w the granny and it made me cry, gosh! So heartwarming. EXCITED TO SEE NAM JOO HYUK AND SUZY AS START-UPRENEURS!",t3_jcpm8v

Also hope the misunderstanding is solved quickly. Would it be too much to ask for ML to tell her the truth first?

46,g9935xq,t3_jcpm8v,Episode 2 actually solidified my interest in this series. No cliche tropes where their company gets invested in straight away and how realistic the comment from Han Ji Pyeong about how he only invested in 30 out of 1000 companies that makes it to his table which I assume is already filtered. It looks like they are gonna struggle a bit before their company gets a solid foundation. Definitely looking forward to the next epsiodes.,t3_jcpm8v

1. I was soooo excited to spot and identify Yoo Su-bin from Crash Landing on You (Kdrama fanatic) and Seo Yi-sook from Hotel del Luna (Mago). I am a new, quarantine drama addict so I feel oddly accomplished when I can recognize common actors.
2. I went in knowing Nam Joo Hyuk from WFKBJ and Kim Joo-hun from IOTNBO were starring in the show but I was still pumped for that. >!The last-minute reveal of NJH and FL's father's death kept me on my toes!< It's definitely a very strong pilot.
3. I don't know if it's just me but it definitely looks like a love triangle is brewing and I unironically love those –– Looking forward to next week's episodes!
4. NJH has two currently airing dramas??? Good looking and hard-working, wowza!

I feel like in this day and age (and maybe because I don’t go outside lately), I haven’t seen too many instances of kindness, and this grandma’s willingness to take the boy in and give him the benefit of the doubt just touched some part of my heart.

60,g93yi4d,t3_jcpm8v,"Woah! This drama has so much potential! Right off the bat, I like the way they Ji pyung was the first character to be introduced instead of Dalmi and Dosan which i thought were like the main ""main"" leads but it seems like all 4 of them are the main leads. His character was given a lot of attention. The backstory was really set up well and the motivations of the characters are made clear. I'll be sure to watch the Injae-Dalmi dynamic as well cause they actresses have great sibling chemistry. Lastly, THE OST SEEMS VERY GOOD. The songs I've heard so far have been great and I'm already looking forward to the next ones. I'm still hung up on IOTNBO which last aired months ago and this is the first drama that I'm really looking forward to so far.",t3_jcpm8v

Also let’s see if Nam Joo-hyuk can convince me next episode... that was a very cute romance origin story with the letters and all.

I mean realistically we don't have to be in love with every special guy in our life. Some men in our lives we are just grateful to have come across with.

69,g9ajfid,t3_jcpm8v,"Episode 2:

I loved the first 2 episodes. I know my answer here(there might not be a show had this happened), but the only thing that annoys me is why HJP didn’t just step up and take the Do San name?

He already noticed her on the bus bench and then followed her to her grandma’s stand. Why not just step in before Suzy started searching... maybe eventually tell her the truth or something. He was there through all the letters and it seemed like he had a small crush on her when he first saw her at the bus stop. If anything, it would’ve at least given her a solid date to show off to her mom/sister. 

I can’t wait to see where this show goes.",t3_jcpm8v
70,g9bx6ru,t3_jcpm8v,"Thoughts after watching episode 2:- 

I thought I’d have major SLS after a first episode with such a sympathetic back story for Ji Pyeong but the production team knew what they were doing because enter Nam Joo Hyuk with his sad, lost puppy face and my heart has just melted for him.

I love that one OST, Day and Night, I think it’s called. It sounds very much like a Jannabi song, so pensive and heartrending even though I have no idea what the lyrics are.

Really strong first 2 episodes! I’m loving all the characters so far - grandma, Ji Pyeong, the 3 Sans in their matching plaid shirts! This is the best drama I’ve seen Suzy in yet!",t3_jcpm8v
71,g94a7rq,t3_jcpm8v,"I went in with no expectations and now I'm wanting more! This was a very well written and perfectly directed pilot episode. I love the OST too. It was a good balance of drama, comedy, and possible romance. I thought the connection they made with the origin of SandBox was clever and it shows that every detail was intentional!",t3_jcpm8v
72,g94e0on,t3_jcpm8v,I've been hyped about this drama since it was first announced w the casting last year. The plot was totally up my alley (I love the idea of tech start-ups).

74,g9f7unn,t3_jcpm8v,"I dont care about all the catfishing and lies in this story but THE MOTHER IN THIS STORY IS JUST UGH. 

NEVER FORGIVE YOUR SELFISH AND GOLD-DIGGING MOTHER, DAL-MI. This premise of making your daughters choose, separating them and not even caring about the one you left behind is seriously ONE of the — if not, THE WORST — scenarios I’ve ever watched in kdrama. Overbearing mother in Something in the Rain suddenly seemed so likable (previously the #1 Most Hated Character in Kdramaland). Start-Up Omma seriously kicked her out of the park. SO MUCH DISGUST WITH THE MOTHER IN THIS DRAMA!",t3_jcpm8v

76,g98rsv7,t3_jcpm8v,"**Episode 1 & 2**

For the entire weekend I was contemplating if I should start this now and I'm not sure if I regret it as yet. And before you at me, that's not a bad statement. Knowing the reputation of both Director and Screenwriter, I contemplated bingeing once the drama was done. I'm still on the fence about it...

Let me start by saying I love Halmeoni!! What's up with all these wise old grandparents and being the emotional and moral rock for their grandkids? I LOVE IT. She must be protected and showered with all the love she deserves. Her words brought me to the bring of tears far too many times than I'm willing to admit. And her dynamic with Ji-Pyung is soo sweet... and speaking of Ji-Pyung...

I am *DEFINITELY* going to experience a heavy case of Second Lead Syndrome. Ji-Pyung's set up was so heart-breakingly good that I can't help myself. I think I might be reaching too far into the future, but I think when he was writing those letters, at one stage it stopped being a chore he did to please Halmeoni, but he might have actually liked Dal-Mi. Whether he figures that out now, or later, I can almost guarantee it's going to happen. Also, Props to Nam Da-Reum who played the younger version of Ji-Pyung... He's an old familiar face and he was phenomenal in this role.

Not gonna lie, I predicted Dal-Mi's father's>! death!< from the moment I first saw him. I don't know, but he had that Tadashi complex, the you-too-good-to-be-left-in-this-world kinda feel, I don't know how else to describe it. What I didn't expect was the metaphor that signified his passing... so elegant and stunning.

Nam Do-San had the very interesting intro for a male lead -Given the fact that we had to wait till the end of the first episode to even see his grown up face -, and it got me more interested in his character. I hope this competition works in his favour.

**^(Side note)** \- It's the first time I've seen Jasper Cho since **Descendants of the Sun**!! It was a true surprise and it looks like he's in for more screen time so... YAY!

Loving the Cinematography, the OST, Direction style and, the premise so far... I hope this drama continues at this standard.",t3_jcpm8v
77,g9d16pl,t3_jcpm8v,"Suzy and acting weird at the bus stop. Name a better duo.

Edit: I felt pretty similar vibe in this drama to While you were sleeping, the camerawork and cinematography, the above mentioned bus stop scene with Suzy and I think the male kid is same as well.

Seems like her late father’s sharing with the lady CEO inspired the creation of Sandbox... I’m thinking that will play a part in the later half of the show.

Also I really hope Do-San admits the truth soon...... not a fan of him stringing her along when he knows the truth! Im rooting for his company’s success so much though. Also, I’m so happy to see my fave fanboy soldier from CLOY!

2nd lead has his moments but generally I feel like he’s kind of an asshole haha.

82,g98ztbl,t3_jcpm8v,I read Do-San’s character description on wiki (assuming someone took this info from the official website character bio) and it says his character wants to turn Dal Mi’s misunderstanding into reality. I hope that means this part of the plot won’t be dragged for too long and she finds out + he’ll start to prove himself to show her he’s that cool Do San she knew from the letters. But there’s a chance they might stick with the misunderstanding plot and have Do San keep up with the lie. Hm,t3_jcpm8v
83,g988hx8,t3_jcpm8v,"Two episodes in and I'm loving this show so far.

Random thoughts:

* Whatever second-lead syndrome I felt after watching the first episode disappeared when Do San started knitting in the train.  LOL.
* So far I am not liking the motivation of the female lead for trying to succeed...to prove her sister wrong?  If she didn't regret her choice in staying with her father, then why is she so intent on proving her sister wrong?
* Loving all the scenes with Ji Pyeong and Grandma, and Do San and his friends.  The male leads are carrying this show so far, and it's mostly because their characters are fleshed out more.  Hoping the two female leads get more depth in the next episodes. (Also, the male leads are making me temporarily forget my issues with Suzy's acting so it's all good)
* And finally, I really wish they resolve this ""catfishing"" storyline early on because the longer they extend it the more uncomfortable it becomes. Poor Dal Mi.  Hey Grandma, why don't you just tell her?!?
* Speaking of Grandma, did she buy Dal Mi a Dior bag? Haha
* We really can't escape the slow motion leading-man entrance, no?  But hey, NJH is handsome, I'll forgive it this time :)
* That ending....  Is he really going to pretend?  And use Ji Pyeong's words in those letters as if they were his own?  Oh no...

It was so sad to see the dad die like that because it could have been prevented and he was so close to getting that investment. I'm really curious to learn more about how Sandbox came to be because the father told the story to the female VC and she was also on the stage in ep1 with won jaein. I also want to know what's won jaein's relationship with han jipyeong.

I don't know who to root for\~ HJP could have just outed himself and introduce himself to her (since he was curious and following her in ep1 after the conference). He was the one she liked from the letters. But I'm also fond of Nam Do San for his shy, awkward, sincere personality.

113,g99sixa,t3_jcpm8v,"Unpopular Opinion

I really liked how well-written the character of Ji Pyeong is. It was consistent. Since he was young, he was extremely cold with a lil bit of warmth when loved. Very typical of a male lead. He started off with literally nothing, a rags to riches story, thus it was reasonable for him not to invest in a small company. Besides, he even offered 2million won, which I assume is a pretty big deal in Korea. On the other hand, I haven't seen much on the character of Do San. Yah, he's poor and aspiring, with a very good heart. That's it for now...

I know Ji Pyeong will be the second lead here, but the way the writers make his character is far more engaging than the ML is one issue I want to be resolved asap. It isn't just justifiable to give him more screentime and more depth especially in the first episode. Imo, if the ML isn't as charismatic as Nam Joo Hyuk, then definitely second lead>>>>>>>> ML.

I really hope some good twist happens. The drama has a lot of potential that got us hooked immediately. I just don't want  the second lead to go in the dirty route after developing his character this much; just for the main leads to have their romance. Just no. Not buying it. (lol i really never find it romantic when someone behind is hurting just like the end of the second ep). But yeah, I still trust the writers in this one.",t3_jcpm8v

140,g9elbjs,t3_jcpm8v,"Ok, it's only now I realized that Park Hye Ryun is the writer. No wonder the storytelling is so good!!! How could I not know this is her next drama? I'm such a big fan of her writing! She always fleshes out characters and her backstories always hook you from the start of the series. I am freaking out now to love her work here even without knowing yet she's the writer.",t3_jcpm8v
141,g9f6hen,t3_jcpm8v,"Random thoughts w/ mostly positives and some negatives:

(+) Love the grandma and Good Boy's interactions and their backstory- their exchange at the train station??? Bus stop?? made me so emotional

(+) Loved all of the grandma's scenes and lines- literally made me so emotional I love her

(-) Dal Mi's mom seemed very unreasonable and unrealistic... it seems like she only cared about money and not happiness, PLUS what kind of mom has a divorce and only keeps in touch with one of her children? (Dal Mi is her biological child... right?)

(+) But she isn't happy now because of her decision in the past so at least she seems human because of the regret

(-) The sister is really mean.. it was a little jarring because I feel like even with divorced parents the kids would still be nice with each other, especially when the're young, and the sister just turned her back on Dal Mi so fast it was strange to see

(+) Maybe she was brainwashed as a kid to think that only money matters and now she's being mean to Dal Mi because she's insecure about her own life- she's successful and rich but clearly not happy (might be rethinking her life choices)

(+) Dal Mi's dad is SUCH a good parent it got me feeling very touched

>!(-) BUT that makes Dal Mi's dad's death seem so jarring, random, unecessary, overly dramatic, but knowing WYWS it seems to be in the category of overly dramatic things that need to happen for the plot to work and I'm okay with just overlooking that small point!<

(+) Love the Samsan boys, they're adorable

(-) Some drawn out slow-mo scenes but it's a kdrama so I'm used to it.. felt a bitttt draggy at times like with Do San's entrance,

(+) But with others like the sad day montage for Dal Mi and Do San were super effective- the pacing gave time for the emotions to sink in and sink in it did (best part of it was Dal Mi's heel breaking and the escalator being out of service, I could feel that frustrated want-to-cry emotion)

(+) Colors and visuals/filming are beautiful but the director does great work so it's expected

(-) I like Good Boy, but not for Dal Mi..  I seriously seriously hate love triangles and if it's something like WYWS I could handle it, but if it becomes a central conflict... oh boy...

(+) Overall, super super excited for the next episodes to come out! Praying so hard that I'll like it until the end because I'm extremely picky and tend to drop midway",t3_jcpm8v

The metaphors are beautiful. How the sisters change their dining habits. From a shared bowl to a cup of drab coffee. The fried chicken. 

I don't find Seo In Jae's character 1D though I do dislike her a bit - but form her PoV it's been survival. And desperation. I really liked Seo Dal Mi. She's got a fighting spirit, and a smile on her face. I love it. Love the child actors. The one who played Ji Pyoung is a great actor. Characters are fleshed out well. 

And start ups. I really think I'm gonna enjoy how they portray them. I think I'm gonna love this. Can't wait for today's episode. 💕💕💕",t3_jcpm8v

149,g972h55,t3_jcpm8v,"First impressions are really high for me so far. Although the premise is riding on the usual comeuppance revenge story, I’m fairly surprised with the twists that came to place, like Do-San being a real person, or Dal-mi’s father passing away on the bus. For some reason I was deeply hit by the grandmas treatment of Good Boy; albeit a stubborn kid that, to many others, is nothing more than a stranger with no place to live, she shows a level of compassion and trust similar to her own son and how he treats her granddaughter. It’s a mirroring experience that really displays how wonderful of a job she did in raising a family with moral values, as opposed to Dal-mi’s mother who was raised into believing that monetary happiness is just as sufficient.",t3_jcpm8v
150,g99mks9,t3_jcpm8v,"Really enjoyed the first two episodes! I like the color grading of this drama, and the music has been really good so far.

I’m getting some Itaewon Class vibes from it - the main guy we see at the beginning is shaping up to be the second lead? The ML is adorable, loving his acting. I think he’s doing a good job taking on interesting projects as an actor.

One thing I can say right away: if The Secret Life of My Secretary taught me anything, it’s that this whole “pretending to be someone you’re not” isn’t going to end well (tho probably endgame anyway)",t3_jcpm8v

I feel like everyone else covered a lot of what I had to say, but I'm surprisingly intrigued by Sam Do San's history and character the most. We don't know much yet but he seems to be incredibly timid/shy/sensitive... almost as if he is operating on a high level of social anxiety? That scene where HJP harshly tells him that Samsan will never succeed and how he tears up... plus knitting? There's definitely something going on here and I cant wait to find out. Out of all the main characters, he's the only one without a fleshed out backstory yet. 

I was a little worried that HJP's character would be far more interesting but after the second episode I am extremely hopeful about SDS being fleshed out properly",t3_jcpm8v

From the previews of the next episode, it seems that they're soon going to win the image recognition challenge which means so far they've been working on some form of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). However, in the Red Velvet OST video, the notes on the board hint at a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). I wonder how that is going to play out.

165,g97vihr,t3_jcpm8v,"So I was just scrolling Netflix and went in blind without knowing who the cast was - and boy was it a great surprise to see ma boy Seonho here!! ❤️

I was expecting this to be a light-hearted office underdog drama, but man Ep 1 took me by surprise with how beautifully written and directed it was. Kim Joohun honestly did a fantastic job as Dalmi's father, his genuine passion in building a better world and his love for his family was very well delivered. And that child actor for Jipyeong was just AMAZING, oh wow the amount of tears I shed at their farewell at the bus terminal. I sure hope the show continues to be as good as this ep was.

Also, it's surprising that Seonho is listed as the SML while NJH is the FML, given how much they explored Jipyeong's childhood in the first ep. Hmmmm. I see the SLS is going to be v strong in this.

Side note: As a data scientist by profession, I'm glad to see some level of accuracy - Nam Dosan was ACTUALLY writing functions with proper syntax woo. Hope they continue to be somewhat accurate in their portrayal of AI practitioners haha",t3_jcpm8v
166,g98y1z0,t3_jcpm8v,First of all I had a little hunch from the first poster itself that this show will be good and the first two episodes have exceeded my expectations! I was still a bit scared when the childhood trope started cause honestly Private lives was such a drag there but! I loved it!! They’re so unfair to set up the Second lead syndrome with the letter trope but I guess there will be an upcoming character change within him that would make the viewers root for Do San & Dalmi! OSTs are a hit already! Today’s ep they also explained a lot of terms which had Korean explanations but Eng explanations wasn’t there in the subtitles! Anyways today the mom is realising leaving the girls dad & her first husband was the wrong thing to do while In Jae was really pissed at that thought! Little Dal Mi was right she persuaded the new guy into her moms life cause she wanted the easy rich life!! Love the show I hope They really reveal the letter truth to Dalmi ASAP!!,t3_jcpm8v
167,g99hjb2,t3_jcpm8v,loving this drama so far ! i love the chemistry already and im not getting sls because im whipped for do sam. i hope they don't carry out the fake do sam thing for too long and focus on the business side,t3_jcpm8v

I'm actually expecting an in jae - do san - dal mi love triangle than one involving 2 males. 

Having said that, I don't actually care that much with the romantic angles of the series as of now. I'm more invested at how grandma and ji pyeong spend more time as grandma and grandson and how they fix whatever problem that arises from the fake do san thing they did in the past.

I also love that it seems like he will make it on his own, without help of Jipyeong. This specially made it all that sweeter after his harsh words. Injae scene at the hotel with her mom was perfect!!! Snapping pretty photos for IG and writing about her perfect life when in reality is far from it. Just teaches you not to believe everything you see on social media. Even if you look through mines all you will see are my happy moments while on vacation, but my everyday reality is not that. 

The mom saying she made a bad choice in her marriage doesn’t give her redeeming points at all. She left one daughter behind, what type of mother is that! And she left her husband because he refused to do things her way. She went with an easy out by marrying rich without thinking of the consequences. To little to late in my opinion. 

So far loving the first 2 episodes and super excited to see the rest! The slow motion entrance was cringe and unnecessary, took way to much time.",t3_jcpm8v

Whether he figures that out now, or later, I can almost guarantee it's going to happen.

i def got the vibe that those letters stopped being a chore for him, too. weren't they writing letters to each other for a year?? there is no way he would have kept it up for that long if it stayed being this ~favor he did for halmeoni.

I understand your thoughts on not needing to prove anything to the sister. But it’s almost pride specially because of her dad.

Im hoping this twist happens too, but I have the foreboding sense it probably won't. Posters show NJH as main lead. Also the rich sister is already a over-the-top mean girl, as though being rich must equal a mean and bad person.",t3_jcpm8v

364,g9a80tu,t1_g9a292p,"Not a CV expert by any means, but just my 2c - GANs can sometimes be used in conjunction with CNNs for image recognition tasks too. One common use case is for data augmentation: generating new labelled images for a larger training dataset and hence training a better model. Another possible use case is in super-resolution: for small and very pixelated images, there isn't enough information and hence can be difficult for the model to classify accurately. GANs can solve this by reconstructing a higher reso image, which is then fed to the original object detection model. 

Tldr at this point in time, my best guess is that they'll use GANs to further improve their existing state-of-the-art object detection model. Then again, the world of Computer Vision is more than just object detection, and they clearly have their basics down, so it's possible that their startup idea could be a lot more interesting (maybe exploring deepfakes? who knows)

It'll be super cool if they actually do delve more into the technical side of things, I'll geek out for sure 😍

When she saw her sister’s current state, shouldn’t her instinct be to want to hug her, to shower her with material stuff that she enjoyed for so many years, and to take care of her younger sister? Not taunt her and make her feel worse. If she were just a school BFF that Dal-mi had a falling out with, I’d understand this reaction from her.

She's probably more aware of their family's status and knew that fried chicken is the best they could afford on a payday while others could have it any day. 
  
>!Just guessing but we will probably see in the future why she chose her mom over the dad despite the fact that the dad was the breadwinner of the family. She knew that it will be harder to live with her mom who will start from scratch. she gave up the chance of having a more comfortable life with her dad but she had to choose her mom so someone can take care of both parents.

She says to her grandmother 'i don't regret my choice, I loved dad and staying with him, but she's making it so my choice to choose dad was me choosing a life less than. Thats why I want to win' (paraphrased). Ideally, you could step back from the situation and chose not to engage ""i know the most mature thing would to be to not engage, living my best life is the best revenge"", but people are humans, and for dalmi proving herself or becoming successful (in certain terms which I am sure will change throughout the drama) is a part of living her best life.",t3_jcpm8v

I'm ok with the charade up until the sixth episode.  Anything longer than that will be absolutely uncomfortable.   

I understand that Grandma doesn't want to tell her NOW especially since Dal Mi is still hurting from seeing her successful sister and her firing from work.  But she has to tell Dal Mi because it was her idea in the first place (and Ji Pyeong was even opposed to it at the start).",t3_jcpm8v

RoY is family centric, a little bit more dramatic than others, and is focussed on the Korean family a bit. I mean yeah the main story is actually PBG's  record of youth but it also has these elements. Start Up is more focussed on, well business and start ups and maybe doesn't reckon with the general population ? Though I agree, no offense to any RoY fans but this show is wayyyyy more engaging and endearing 😅😅",t3_jcpm8v
438,g9arotf,t1_g9apmqh,"One thing you have to realize is that majority of the people who post on Reddit are not Korean.  What international audiences like may not necessarily be the same as what Koreans like.

Another reason is that NJH is not really as big of a draw compared to other more popular male actors and let’s face it... more women watch KDrama then men (so the audience is usually drawn more towards the male leads, not the female leads)

That being said, it’s just the second episode anyway 🤷🏻‍♀️",t3_jcpm8v
439,g9aqhic,t1_g9apmqh,Oh wow. Really weird because i really dont have any complaints for the drama as of now. ROY is the only drama i’m watching rn aside from Start-up and i love both the leads but godamnit why is is everything in that drama so robotic 💀 I’m still gonna finish it tho.,t3_jcpm8v
440,g9aq0oh,t1_g9aoyh5,"Exactly my point. So far, the second lead is faaar way better than the male lead. I really hope the male lead's character will develop more than the second lead without playing dirty on the latter's character.

444,g9461ab,t1_g945fp5,Yes I was the same >!I really really didn’t want him to die. I wanted him to succeed but to let him be on the cusp of success and have it come to nothing was just too cruel.

The family relationships have really drawn me in, if they’d just done a typical meeting between the leads with a tiny bit of back story thrown in I don’t think I’d be here writing comments! As it is now, with just one episode they’ve got me majorly rooting for some characters already, and wanting to know more about the motivations of others. Great set up.

Looking forward to reading your insights as the drama continues. I’ve actually been in a mini kdrama slump ever since IOTNBO and can only take dramas in small doses so I’m pretty much only watching currently airing dramas. Are you watching 18 Again? This one also has a strong focus on relationships between family members and is one of my faves out of all the currently airing dramas. I think you may like it!",t3_jcpm8v

455,gaczrf8,t1_g9dvbef,I am annoyed at In-jae as well but probably as the show goes on we will know why she acted that way. My guess is that she envied her little sister because she didn't have the courage to stand by her dad during hardship like Dal-mi and how her mom seemed to care more about Dal-mi. Just my thoughts though and it's too early to tell so lets see XD,t3_jcpm8v
456,g9xu1pl,t1_g9dvbef,It looks like through the montage of the two meeting together after the divorce is even In Jae changed into who she is today. There’s several body language queues that seem to suggest as such,t3_jcpm8v

462,g9aitzs,t1_g97ezdg,">!Nam Do-san is Ji Pyung's pen name. Unbeknownst to them, Nam Do-san is a real person, and i think Dal-mi found the real Do-san before Ji-pyung could spill the beans. So Ji-pyung ends up telling Do-san to pretend that he was the one sending the letters.!<",t3_jcpm8v
463,g93qous,t1_g9353dv,"It’s also better that Netflix gets these series from
the Korean networks versus producing their own. They have this strange pattern of half starting series like Love Alarm and then checking the ratings before making a decision to finish the series whereas the networks at least have a full season a show.
